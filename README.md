# Graph-MST-Kruskal

Implements **Kruskal’s algorithm** to find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a weighted, undirected graph.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Finds the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** using Kruskal’s algorithm.
- Works for **weighted, undirected graphs**.
- Uses **Disjoint Set (Union-Find)** data structure for cycle detection.
- Outputs the **edges included in the MST** and the **total weight**.
